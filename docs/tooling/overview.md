## SLPDB

SLPDB is the most advanced indexer for SLP transactions, and allows you to perform advanced queries upon it. We have dedicated a whole page of [examples](/tooling/slpdb_examples) to help you get up to speed right away with the most common types of queries.

## GS++

GS++ is a high performance validator, indexer, and graph search server. This allows wallets to be able to trustlessly validate transactions, or for businesses to have a very stable and reliable trusted validation setup. It also contains the meat of SLP's fuzzing systems, running billions of tests and ensuring other implementations are valid.
